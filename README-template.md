## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid (to center the card with place-items: center)
- Flexbox (to align items inside the card)
- Mobile-first workflow
- hover animation

### What I learned

I learned that I need to add an accessible name or aria-label to the learning button to clarify its purpose.

```HTML
<button type="button" aria-label="Learn about HTML & CSS foundations">Learning</button>
```

### Continued development
